# ML for Beginners

Welcome to the **ML for Beginners** repository! This repository contains lecture notebooks, projects, datasets, and supporting assets to help you learn and practice machine learning with Python. All examples are hands-on and designed to build your skills from basics to intermediate ML techniques.
- Provides **a friendly introduction** for new learners.  
- Includes **setup instructions** for your environment.  
- Shows a **clear folder map** so users know where to find notebooks, data, and projects.  
- Gives **usage instructions** to run the notebooks.
