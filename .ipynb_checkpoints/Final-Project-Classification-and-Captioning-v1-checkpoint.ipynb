Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: \"dent\" and \"crack.\" For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.\n","\n","## **Aim of the Project**\n","\n","The goal of this project is to develop an automated model that accurately classifies aircraft damage from images. By the end of the project, you will have trained and evaluated a model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore, the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images, providing a detailed description of the damage.\n","\n","## **Final Output**\n","\n","- A trained model capable of classifying aircraft images into \"dent\" and \"crack\" categories, enabling automated aircraft damage detection.\n","- A Transformer-based model that generates captions and summaries of images\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"031c7b9f-a88a-4163-ace0-8c0c4eff210c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["You will be using the [Aircraft dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/ZjXM4RKxlBK9__ZjHBLl5A/aircraft-damage-dataset-v1.tar).\n","The dataset is taken from the here (Original Source): [Roboflow Aircraft Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/youssef-donia-fhktl/aircraft-damage-detection-1j9qk) Provided by a Roboflow user, License: CC BY 4.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d2e6a04-b9e7-47b0-a459-c24900a61249","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n"," \n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","    <p><font size=\"5\">Part 1 - Classification Problem: Classifying the defect on the aircraft as 'dent' or 'crack'</p>\n","<font size=\"3\">\n","        1. <a href=\"#1.1-Dataset-Preparation\">1.1 Dataset Preparation</a><br>\n","        2. <a href=\"#1.2-Data-Preprocessing\">1.2 Data Preprocessing</a><br>\n","        3. <a href=\"#1.3-Model-Definition\">1.3 Model Definition</a><br>\n","        4. <a href=\"#1.4-Model-Training\">1.4 Model Training</a><br>\n","        5. <a href=\"#1.5-Visualizing-Training-Results\">1.5 Visualizing Training Results</a><br>\n","        6. <a href=\"#1.6-Model-Evaluation\">1.6 Model Evaluation</a><br>\n","        7. <a href=\"#1.7-Visualizing-Predictions\">1.7 Visualizing Predictions</a><br>\n","    <br>\n","<p><font size=\"5\">Part 2: Image Captioning and Summarization using BLIP Pretrained Model</p>\n","<font size=\"3\">\n","        1. <a href=\"#2.1-Loading-BLIP-Model\">2.1 Loading BLIP Model</a><br>\n","        2. <a href=\"#2.2-Generating-Captions-and-Summaries\">2.2 Generating Captions and Summaries</a><br>\n","        <br>\n","    \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e3af8bcb-f835-4ca1-b081-95efee7f10d6","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# 1.1 Dataset-Preparation\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"17ea9c92-15e5-4a9a-9534-a2d9b6e9fef2","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","After you complete the project, you will be able to:\n","\n","- Use the VGG16 model for image classification.\n","- Prepare and preprocess image data for a machine learning task.\n","- Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.\n","- Visualize model predictions on test data.\n","- Use a custom Keras layer. \n","\n","\n"," ### Task List\n","To achieve the above objectives, you will complete the following tasks:\n","\n","- Task 1: Create a `valid_generator` using the `valid_datagen` object\n","- Task 2: Create a `test_generator` using the `test_datagen` object\n","- Task 3: Load the VGG16 model\n","- Task 4: Compile the model\n","- Task 5: Train the model\n","- Task 6: Plot accuracy curves for training and validation sets \n","- Task 7: Visualizing the results \n","- Task 8: Implement a Helper Function to Use the Custom Keras Layer\n","- Task 9: Generate a caption for an image using the using BLIP pretrained model\n","- Task 10: Generate a summary of an image using BLIP pretrained model\n","\n","**Note**:.<br>\n","1.
